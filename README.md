#Series Organizer
*Organize your shows and track your progress*

##About
Series Organizer is an Add-on for Firefox that will allow you to manage a list of the current shows you are watching so you always know what episode you're on and can keep track of shows you want to watch. It is currently in development.

##Testing from source
Add-ons that are not signed by Mozilla cannot be enabled on Release versions of Firefox, a [Developer's Editon](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) is required.
The Jetpack Manager (jpm) is also required to run the add-on. Follow [this guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tools/jpm) to install.
Once jpm is installed, execute the run command with the binary flag (-b) and point it to the Developer's Edition of Firefox
```
jpm run -b "C:\Firefox Developer Edition\firefox.exe"
```
